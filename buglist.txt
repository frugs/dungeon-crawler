### GAME ISSUES
    -- Rotation has trouble if we get to the destination before we've finished rotating. Persist the direction we need to face in the chain?
    -- Occasional glitches when machine is under load and tpf < 1/60

### FIXED ISSUES
    -- Player occasionally spins 180 at the end of a PlayerMove chain, probably caused by travelling past the destination [FIXED]
    -- Messed up rotation [FIXED]
